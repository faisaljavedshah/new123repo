          <div class="policyList">
            <div><span>1. Length of Service:</span> The length of service for this Agreement is based on the application for service completed in conjunction with this Agreement. This Agreement begins on the date the accompanying Application is submitted and continues for the term agreed to on the Application</div>
            <div><span>2. Ownership of numbers:</span> Tracking numbers assigned to Customer for use on Customer’s account are leased to Customer for purposes of this Agreement, but remain the property of Convirza through the end of the term of Service. Portability of numbers at the termination of service may be limited by the telecommunications service providers in the area in which Customer’s numbers are located and is subject to transfer fees. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer must either pay the applicable transfer (if number portability is available for its numbers in that area) or must cease to use the tracking numbers covered by this Agreement and shall cease distributing such numbers and shall take all reasonable steps to remove the numbers from use in any marketing venues including publications, advertisements, promotions, websites, etc. During the term of Service in this Agreement, Customer may not sublease, assign, or allocate tracking numbers included in this Agreement to third parties or use such numbers in any way not set forth in the terms of this Agreement without express written permission from Convirza or without a separate Affiliate, Reseller, or Integrator agreement in place. Convirza reserves the right to reallocate numbers not currently in use by Customer at its discretion. In the event that Customer suspends or terminates this Service for any reason, including breach or non-payment of fees, Customer acknowledges that the tracking numbers or toll-free numbers it had prior to suspension or termination of the Agreement may no longer be available. All tracking numbers (whether toll free or local) provisioned on CLIENT’s behalf belong to Convirza during the term of this Agreement. Any numbers ported in by client will be managed by Convirza. CLIENT is responsible for testing any tracking numbers assigned to or provisioned for CLIENT before publishing them.

A standard $40 per-number transfer fee will apply. Numbers not ported out by CLIENT at the end of the agreement may be assigned to other customers or transferred to third-party carriers. The PARTIES understand that 3rd party telecom carriers used for the Services often charge large per number Local Number Portability (LNP) fees (as much as $400 or more per Number) for porting Numbers back out within a short period after they were ported in. To avoid those fees, the PARTIES agree that CLIENT will not port Numbers back out for at least 30 days after successfully porting them to Convirza or will be responsible for all carrier per Number LNP fees on top of Convirza’s standard fees associated with porting out those Numbers.</div>
